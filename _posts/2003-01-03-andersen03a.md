title: A Bayesian Approach to Bergman’s Minimal Model
abstract: The classical minimal model of glucose disposal was proposed as a powerful
  modeling approach to estimating the insulin sensitivity and the glucose effectiveness,
  which are very useful in the study of diabetes. The minimal model is a highly ill-posed
  inverse problem and most often the reconstruction of the glucose kinetics has been
  done by deterministic iterative numerical algorithms. However, these algorithms
  do not consider the severe ill-posedness inherent in the minimal model and may only
  be efficient when a good initial estimate is provided. In this work we adopt graphical
  models as a powerful and flexible modeling framework for regularizing the problem
  and thereby allow for estimation of the insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness.
  We illustrate how the reconstruction algorithm may be efficiently implemented in
  a Bayesian approach where posterior sampling is made through the use of Markov chain
  Monte Carlo techniques. We demonstrate the method on simulated data.
