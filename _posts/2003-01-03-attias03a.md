title: Planning by Probabilistic Inference
abstract: This paper presents and demonstrates a new approach to the problem of planning
  under uncertainty. Actions are treated as hidden variables, with their own prior
  distributions, in a probabilistic generative model involving actions and states.
  Planning is done by computing the posterior distribution over actions, conditioned
  on reaching the goal state within a specified number of steps. Under the new formulation,
  the toolbox of inference techniques be brought to bear on the planning problem.
  This paper focuses on problems with discrete actions and states, and discusses some
  extensions.
