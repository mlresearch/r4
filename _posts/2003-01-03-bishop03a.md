title: Super-resolution Enhancement of Video
abstract: We consider the problem of enhancing the resolution of video through the
  addition of perceptually plausible high frequency information. Our approach is based
  on a learned data set of image patches capturing the relationship between the middle
  and high spatial frequency bands of natural images. By introducing an appropriate
  prior distribution over such patches we can ensure consistency of static image regions
  across successive frames of the video, and also take account of object motion. A
  key concept is the use of the previously enhanced frame to provide part of the training
  set for super-resolution enhancement of the current frame. Our results show that
  a marked improvement in video quality can be achieved at reasonable computational
  cost.
