title: Structured Variational Distributions in VIBES
abstract: Variational methods are becoming increasingly popular for the approximate
  solution of complex probabilistic models in machine learning, computer vision, information
  retrieval and many other fields. Unfortunately, for every new application it is
  necessary first to derive the specific forms of the variational update equations
  for the particular probabilistic model being used, and then to implement these equations
  in applicationspecific software. Each of these steps is both time consuming and
  error prone. We have therefore recently developed a general purpose inference engine
  called VIBES [1] (’Variational Inference for Bayesian Networks’) which allows a
  wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally
  without recourse to coding. New models are specified as a directed acyclic graph
  using an interface analogous to a drawing package, and VIBES then automatically
  generates and solves the variational equations. The original version of VIBES assumed
  a fully factorized variational posterior distribution. In this paper we present
  an extension of VIBES in which the variational posterior distribution corresponds
  to a sub-graph of the full probabilistic model. Such structured distributions can
  produce much closer approximations to the true posterior distribution. We illustrate
  this approach using an example based on Bayesian hidden Markov models.
