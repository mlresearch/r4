title: A Unifying Theorem for Spectral Embedding and Clustering
abstract: 'Spectral methods use selected eigenvectors of a data affinity matrix to
  obtain a data representation that can be trivially clustered or embedded in a low-dimensional
  space. We present a theorem that explains, for broad classes of affinity matrices
  and eigenbases, why this works: For successively smaller eigenbases (i.e., using
  fewer and fewer of the affinity matrixâ€™s dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors),
  the angles between "similar" vectors in the new representation shrink while the
  angles between "dissimilar" vectors grow. Specifically, the sum of the squared cosines
  of the angles is strictly increasing as the dimensionality of the representation
  decreases. Thus spectral methods work because the truncated eigenbasis amplifies
  structure in the data so that any heuristic post-processing is more likely to succeed.
  We use this result to construct a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) algorithm
  for data sampled from manifolds whose intrinsic coordinate system has linear and
  cyclic axes, and a novel clustering-by-projections algorithm that requires no post-processing
  and gives superior performance on "challenge problems" from the recent literature.'
