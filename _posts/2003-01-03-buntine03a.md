title: Is Multinomial PCA Multi-faceted Clustering or Dimensionality Reduction?
abstract: 'Discrete analogues to Principal Components Analysis (PCA) are intended
  to handle discrete or positive-only data, for instance sets of documents. The class
  of methods is appropriately called multinomial PCA because it replaces the Gaussian
  in the probabilistic formulation of PCA with a multinomial. Experiments to date,
  however, have been on small data sets, for instance, from early information retrieval
  collections. This paper demonstrates the method on two large data sets and considers
  two extremes of behaviour: (1) dimensionality reduction where the feature set (i.e.,
  bag of words) is considerably reduced, and (2) multi-faceted clustering (or aspect
  modelling) where clustering is done but items can now belong in several clusters
  at once.'
