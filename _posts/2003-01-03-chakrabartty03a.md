title: Expectation Maximization of Forward Decoding Kernel Machines
abstract: Forward Decoding Kernel Machines (FDKM) combine large-margin kernel classifiers
  with Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) adaptive sequence
  estimation. This paper proposes a variant on FDKM training using ExpectationMaximization
  (EM). Parameterization of the expectation step controls the temporal extent of the
  context used in correcting noisy and missing labels in the training sequence. Experiments
  with EM-FDKM on TIMIT phone sequence data demonstrate up to $10 %$ improvement in
  classification performance over FDKM trained with hard transitions between labels.
