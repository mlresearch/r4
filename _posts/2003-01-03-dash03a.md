title: Model Averaging with Bayesian Network Classifiers
abstract: This paper considers the problem of performing classification by model-averaging
  over a class of discrete Bayesian network structures consistent with a partial ordering
  and with bounded in-degree $k .$ We show that for $N$ nodes this class contains
  in the worst-case at least $\Omega\left(\left(\begin{array}{c}N/2 \\{k}\end{array}\right)^{N
  / 2} \right)$ distinct network structures, but we show that this summation can be
  performed in $O\left(\left(\begin{array}{c}N \\{k}\end{array}\right) \cdot N\right)$  time.
  We use this fact to show that it is possible to efficiently construct a single directed
  acyclic graph (DAG) whose predictions approximate those of exact model-averaging
  over this class, allowing approximate model-averaged predictions to be performed
  in $O(N)$ time. We evaluate the procedure in a supervised classification context,
  and show empirically that this technique can be beneficial for classification even
  when the generating distribution is not a member of the class being averaged over,
  and we characterize the performance over several parameters on simulated and real-world
  data.
