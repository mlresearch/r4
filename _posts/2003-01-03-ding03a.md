title: 'Document Retrieval and Clustering: from Principal Component Analysis to Self-aggregation
  Networks'
abstract: Abstract. We first extend Hopfield networks to clustering bipartite graphs
  (words-to-document association) and show that the solution is the principal component
  analysis. We then generalize this via the min-max clustering principle into a self-aggregation
  networks which are composed of scaled PCA components via Hebb rule. Clustering amounts
  to an updating process where connections between different clusters are automatically
  suppressed while connections within same clusters are enhanced. This framework combines
  dimension reduction with clustering via neural networks and PCA. Self-aggregation
  networks can also improve information retrieval performance. Applications are presented.
