title: On the Naive Bayes Model for Text Categorization
abstract: This paper empirically compares the performance of four probabilistic models
  for text classification - Poisson, Bernoulli, Multinomial and Negative Binomial.
  We examine the "naive Bayes" assumption in the four models and show that the multinomial
  model is a modified naive Bayes Poisson model that assumes independence of document
  length and document class. Despite the fact that this last assumption might not
  be correct in many situations, we find that, in general, relaxing it does not change
  the performance of the classifier. Finally we propose and evaluate an ad-hoc method
  for incorporating document length.
