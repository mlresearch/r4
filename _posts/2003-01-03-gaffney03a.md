title: Curve Clustering with Random Effects Regression Mixtures
abstract: In this paper we address the problem of clustering sets of curve or trajectory
  data generated by groups of objects or individuals. The focus is to model curve
  data directly using a set of model-based curve clustering algorithms referred to
  as mixtures of regressions or regression mixtures. The proposed methodology is based
  on extension to regression mixtures that we call random effects regression mixtures
  which combines linear random effects models with standard regression mixtures. We
  develop a general expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm using maximum a posteriori
  (MAP) estimation for random effects regression mixtures and demonstrate how this
  technique can be applied to the problem of clustering cyclone data.
