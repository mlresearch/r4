title: Clustering Markov States into Equivalence Classes using SVD and Heuristic Search
  Algorithms
abstract: 'This paper investigates the problem of finding a $K$-state first-order
  Markov chain that approximates an $M$-state first-order Markov chain, where $K$
  is typically much smaller than $M$. A variety of greedy heuristic search algorithms
  that maximize the data likelihood are investigated and found to work well empirically.
  The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on two applications: learning user models
  from traces of Unix commands, and word segmentation in language modeling.'
