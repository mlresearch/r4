title: Rapid Evaluation of Multiple Density Models
abstract: When highly-accurate and/or assumptionfree density estimation is needed,
  nonparametric methods are often called upon - most notably the popular kernel density
  estimation (KDE) method. However, the practitioner is instantly faced with the formidable
  computational cost of KDE for appreciable dataset sizes, which becomes even more
  prohibitive when many models with different kernel scales (bandwidths) must be evaluated
  - this is necessary for finding the optimal model, among other reasons. In previous
  work we presented an algorithm for fast KDE which addresses large dataset sizes
  and large dimensionalities, but assumes only a single bandwidth. In this paper we
  present a generalization of that algorithm allowing multiple models with different
  bandwidths to be computed simultaneously, in substantially less time than either
  running the singlebandwidth algorithm for each model independently, or running the
  standard exhaustive method. We show examples of computing the likelihood curve for
  100,000 data and 100 models ranging across 3 orders of magnitude in scale, in minutes
  or seconds.
