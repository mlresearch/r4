title: Bayesian Feature Weighting for Unsupervised Learning, with Application to Object
  Recognition
abstract: We present a method for variable selection/weighting in an unsupervised
  learning context using Bayesian shrinkage. The basis for the model is a finite mixture
  of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We demonstrate how the model parameters
  and cluster assignments can be computed simultaneously using an efficient EM algorithm.
  Applying our Bayesian shrinkage model to a complex problem in object recognition
  (Duygulu, Barnard, de Freitas and Forsyth 2002), our experiments yield good results.
