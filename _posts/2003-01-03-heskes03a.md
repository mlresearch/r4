title: Generalized belief propagation for approximate inference in hybrid Bayesian
  networks
abstract: We apply generalized belief propagation to approximate inference in hybrid
  Bayesian networks. In essence, in the algorithms developed for discrete networks
  we only have to change "strong marginalization" (exact) into "weak marginalization"
  (same moments) or, equivalently, the "sum" operation in the (generalized) sum-product
  algorithm into a "collapse" operation. We describe both a message-free single-loop
  algorithm based on fixed-point iteration and a more tedious double-loop algorithm
  guaranteed to converge to a minimum of the Kikuchi free energy. With the cluster
  variation method we can interpolate between the minimal Kikuchi approximation and
  the (strong) junction tree algorithm. Simulations on the emission network of [7]
  , extended in [13], indicate that the Kikuchi approximation in practice often works
  really well, even in the difficult case of discrete children of continuous parents.
