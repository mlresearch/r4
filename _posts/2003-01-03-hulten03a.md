title: 'Learning Bayesian Networks From Dependency Networks: A Preliminary Study'
abstract: 'In this paper we describe how to learn Bayesian networks from a summary
  of complete data in the form of a dependency network rather than from data directly.
  This method allows us to gain the advantages of both representations: scalable algorithms
  for learning dependency networks and convenient inference with Bayesian networks.
  Our approach is to use a dependency network as an "oracle" for the statistics needed
  to learn a Bayesian network. We show that the general problem is NP-hard and develop
  a greedy search algorithm. We conduct a preliminary experimental evaluation and
  find that the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian networks constructed from our
  algorithm almost equals that of Bayesian networks learned directly from the data.'
