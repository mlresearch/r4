title: Convex Invariance Learning
abstract: Invariance and representation learning are important precursors to modeling
  and classification tools particularly for non-Euclidean spaces such as images, strings
  and nonvectorial data. This article proposes a method for learning invariances in
  data while jointly estimating a model. The technique results in a convex programming
  problem with a consistent and unique solution. Representation variables are considered
  as affine transformations confined by multiple equality and inequality constraints.
  These interact individually with each datum yet maintain the overall solvability
  of the model estimation process while uniquely solving for the representational
  variables themselves. The method is applicable to various types of modeling, including
  maximum likelihood estimation, principal components analysis, and discriminative
  methods. Starting from affine invariance, several types of invariances are proposed
  and implemented as convex programs including clustering, permutation, selection,
  rotation, and translation. Experiments on non-vectorial data such as images and
  collections of tuples provide promising results.
