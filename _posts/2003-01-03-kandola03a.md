title: Refining Kernels for Regression and Uneven Classification Problems
abstract: 'Kernel alignment has recently been proposed as a method for measuring the
  degree of agreement between a kernel and a classification learning task. In this
  paper we extend the notion of kernel alignment to two other common learning problems:
  regression and classification with uneven data. We present a modified definition
  of alignment together with a novel theoretical justification for why improving alignment
  will lead to better performance in the regression case. Experimental evidence is
  provided to show that improving the alignment leads to a reduction in generalization
  error of standard regressors and classifiers.'
