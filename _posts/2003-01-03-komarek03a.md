title: Fast Robust Logistic Regression for Large Sparse Datasets with Binary Outputs
abstract: Although popular and extremely well established in mainstream statistical
  data analysis, logistic regression is strangely absent in the field of data mining.
  There are two possible explanations of this phenomenon. First, there might be an
  assumption that any tool which can only produce linear classification boundaries
  is likely to be trumped by more modern nonlinear tools. Second, there is a legitimate
  fear that logistic regression cannot practically scale up to the massive dataset
  sizes to which modern data mining tools are applied. This paper consists of an empirical
  examination of the first assumption, and surveys, implements and compares techniques
  by which logistic regression can be scaled to data with millions of attributes and
  records. Our results, on a large life sciences dataset, indicate that logistic regression
  can perform surprisingly well, both statistically and computationally, when compared
  with an array of more recent classification algorithms.
