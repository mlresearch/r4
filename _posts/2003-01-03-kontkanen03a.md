title: Efficient Computing of Stochastic Complexity
abstract: Stochastic complexity of a data set is defined as the shortest possible
  code length for the data obtainable by using some fixed set of models. This measure
  is of great theoretical and practical importance as a tool for tasks such as model
  selection or data clustering. Unfortunately, computing the modern version of stochastic
  complexity, defined as the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) criterion, requires
  computing a sum with an exponential number of terms. Therefore, in order to be able
  to apply the stochastic complexity measure in practice, in most cases it has to
  be approximated. In this paper, we show that for some interesting and important
  cases with multinomial data sets, the exponentiality can be removed without loss
  of accuracy. We also introduce a new computationally efficient approximation scheme
  based on analytic combinatorics and assess its accuracy, together with earlier approximations,
  by comparing them to the exact form. The results suggest that due to its accuracy
  and efficiency, the new sharper approximation will be useful for a wide class of
  problems with discrete data.
