title: The Joint Causal Effect in Linear Structural Equation Model and Its Application
  to Process Analysis
abstract: Consider a case where cause-effect relationships among variables can be
  described by a causal diagram and the corresponding linear structural equation model.
  In order to bring a response variable close to a target, this paper proposes a statistical
  method for inferring a joint causal effect of a conditional plan on the variance
  of a response variable from nonexperimental data. Moreover, based on this method,
  this paper formulates a conditional plan, which can cancel the influence of covariates
  on a response variable. The results of this paper could enable us to select an effective
  plan in linear conditional plans.
