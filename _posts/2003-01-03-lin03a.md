title: Reduced Rank Approximations of Transition Matrices
abstract: We present various latent variable models for the reduced rank approximation
  of transition matrices. Two main categories of models, termed Latent Markov Analysis(LMA)
  models, are introduced. We first address the case where the transition matrix is
  consistent with a reversible random walk. A more general case is subsequently addressed.
  Iterative EM-type algorithms are presented for all models. LMA is applied to clustering
  based on pairwise similarities, where similarities between objects are described
  probabilistically. In the model, relationships between the inferred clusters are
  again described probabilistically by the reduced rank transition matrix. LMA simultaneously
  infers the clusters and abstracts the relationships between them, which can be represented
  in the form of a weighted graph. Finally, a "targeted" LMA model is introduced where
  a prior specification of the transition between latent cluster states is incorporated.
  This provides an algorithm which searches for clusters satisfying pre-specified
  relationships.
