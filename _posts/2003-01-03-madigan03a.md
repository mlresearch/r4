title: On Retrieval Properties of Samples of Large Collections
abstract: We consider text retrieval applications that assign query-specific relevance
  scores to documents drawn from particular collections. Such applications represent
  a primary focus of the annual Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) where the participants
  compare the empirical performance of different approaches. $P@K$, the proportion
  of the top $K$ documents that are relevant, is a popular measure of retrieval effectiveness.
  Participants in the TREC Very Large Corpus track have observed that $P @ K$ increases
  substantially when moving from a sample to the full collection. Hawking et al. (1999)
  posed as an open research question the cause of this phenomenon and proposed five
  possible explanatory hypotheses. In this paper we present a mathematical analysis
  of the phenomenon. We will also introduce "contamination at $K, "$ the number of
  irrelevant documents amongst the top $K$ relevant documents, and describe its properties.
  Our analysis shows that while $P @ K$ typically will increase with collection size,
  the phenomenon is not universal. That is, there exist score distributions for which
  $P @ K$ (and $C @ K$ ) approach a constant limit as collection size increases.
