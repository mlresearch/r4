title: Data Centering in Feature Space
abstract: This paper presents a family of methods for data translation in feature
  space, to be used in conjunction with kernel machines. The translations are performed
  using only kernel evaluations in input space. We use the methods to improve the
  numerical properties of kernel machines. Experiments with synthetic and real data
  demonstrate the effectiveness of data centering and highlight other interesting
  aspects of translation in feature space.
