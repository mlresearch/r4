title: 'A Blessing of Dimensionality: Measure Concentration and Probabilistic Inference'
abstract: This paper proposes an efficient sampling method for inference in probabilistic
  graphical models. The method exploits a blessing of dimensionality known as the
  concentration of measure phenomenon in order to derive analytic expressions for
  proposal distributions. The method can also be interpreted in a variational setting,
  were one minimises an upperbound on the estimator variance. The results on simple
  settings are very promising. We believe this method has great potential in graphical
  models used for diagnosis.
