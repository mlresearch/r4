title: Real-time On-line Learning of Transformed Hidden Markov Models from Video
abstract: The transformed hidden Markov model is a temporal model that captures three
  typical causes of variability in video - scene/object class, appearance variability
  within the class, and image motion. In our previous work, we showed that an exact
  EM algorithm can jointly learn the appearances of multiple objects and/or poses
  of an object, and track the objects or camera motion in video, starting simply from
  random initialization. As such, this model can serve as a basis for both video clustering
  and object tracking applications. However, the original algorithm requires a significant
  amount of computation that renders it impractical for video clustering and its off-line
  nature makes it unsuitable for real-time tracking applications. In this paper, we
  propose a new, significantly faster, on-line learning algorithm that enables real-time
  clustering and tracking. We demonstrate that the algorithm can extract objects using
  the constraints on their motion and also perform tracking while the appearance models
  are learned. We also demonstrate the clustering results on an example of typical
  unrestricted personal media - the vacation video.
