title: Ensemble Coupled Hidden Markov Models for Joint Characterisation of Dynamic
  Signals
abstract: How does one model data with the aid of labels, when the labels themselves
  are noisy, unreliable and have their own dynamics? How does one measure interactions
  between variables that are so different in their nature that a direct comparison
  using, say cross-correlations, is meaningless? In this paper these problems are
  approached using Coupled Hidden Markov Models which are estimated in the Variational
  Bayesian framework. Signals can be diverse since each chain has its own observation
  model. Signals can have their own dynamics and may temporally lag or lead one another
  by allowing linking edges in the network topology to be estimated and chosen according
  to the most probable posterior model. Integrated feature extraction and modelling
  is accomplished by providing the Markov models models with linear observations models.
  We derive Coupled Hidden Markov Models estimators, apply and compare them with sampling
  based approaches found in the literature.
