title: A Generalized Linear Model for Principal Component Analysis of Binary Data
abstract: We investigate a generalized linear model for dimensionality reduction of
  binary data. The model is related to principal component analysis (PCA) in the same
  way that logistic regression is related to linear regression. Thus we refer to the
  model as logistic PCA. In this paper, we derive an alternating least squares method
  to estimate the basis vectors and generalized linear coefficients of the logistic
  PCA model. The resulting updates have a simple closed form and are guaranteed at
  each iteration to improve the model’s likelihood. We evaluate the performance of
  logistic PCA—as measured by reconstruction error rates—on data sets drawn from four
  real world applications. In general, we find that logistic PCA is much better suited
  to modeling binary data than conventional PCA.
