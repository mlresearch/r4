title: Fast Forward Selection to Speed Up Sparse Gaussian Process Regression
abstract: We present a method for the sparse greedy approximation of Bayesian Gaussian
  process regression, featuring a novel heuristic for very fast forward selection.
  Our method is essentially as fast as an equivalent one which selects the "support"
  patterns at random, yet it can outperform random selection on hard curve fitting
  tasks. More importantly, it leads to a sufficiently stable approximation of the
  log marginal likelihood of the training data, which can be optimised to adjust a
  large number of hyperparameters automatically. We demonstrate the model selection
  capabilities of the algorithm in a range of experiments. In line with the development
  of our method, we present a simple view on sparse approximations for GP models and
  their underlying assumptions and show relations to other methods.
