title: On Improving the Efficiency of the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure
abstract: Iterative proportional fitting (IPF) on junction trees is an important tool
  for learning in graphical models. We identify the propagation and IPF updates on
  the junction tree as fixed point equations of a single constrained entropy maximization
  problem. This allows a more efficient message updating protocol than the well known
  effective IPF of Jiroušek and Preučil (1995). When the junction tree has an intractably
  large maximum clique size we propose to maximize an approximate constrained entropy
  based on region graphs (Yedidia et al., 2002). To maximize the new objective we
  propose a "loopy" version of IPF. We show that this yields accurate estimates of
  the weights of undirected graphical models in a simple experiment.
