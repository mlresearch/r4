title: Discriminative Model Selection for Density Models
abstract: Density models are a popular tool for building classifiers. When using density
  models to build a classifier, one typically learns a separate density model for
  each class of interest. These density models are then combined to make a classifier
  through the use of Bayesâ€™ rule utilizing the prior distribution over the classes.
  In this paper, we provide a discriminative method for choosing among alternative
  density models for each class to improve classification accuracy.
