title: Fast Marginal Likelihood Maximisation for Sparse Bayesian Models
abstract: The ’sparse Bayesian’ modelling approach, as exemplified by the ’relevance
  vector machine’, enables sparse classification and regression functions to be obtained
  by linearlyweighting a small number of fixed basis functions from a large dictionary
  of potential candidates. Such a model conveys a number of advantages over the related
  and very popular ’support vector machine’, but the necessary ’training’ procedure
  - optimisation of the marginal likelihood function is typically much slower. We
  describe a new and highly accelerated algorithm which exploits recently-elucidated
  properties of the marginal likelihood function to enable maximisation via a principled
  and efficient sequential addition and deletion of candidate basis functions.
