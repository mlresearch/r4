title: Sequential Importance Sampling for Visual Tracking Reconsidered
abstract: We consider the task of filtering dynamical systems observed in noise by
  means of sequential importance sampling when the proposal is restricted to the innovation
  components of the state. It is argued that the unmodified sequential importance
  sampling/resampling (SIR) algorithm may yield high variance estimates of the posterior
  in this case, resulting in poor performance when e.g. in visual tracking one tries
  to build a SIR algorithm on the top of the output of a color blob detector. A new
  method that associates the innovations sampled from the proposal and the particles
  in a separate computational step is proposed. The method is shown to outperform
  the unmodified SIR algorithm in a series of vision based object tracking experiments,
  both in terms of accuracy and robustness.
