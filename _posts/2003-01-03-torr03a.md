title: Solving Markov Random Fields using Semi Definite Programming
abstract: This paper explores a new generic method for matching, when there are conditional
  dependencies between the matches. It allows different sorts of features to be matched
  in the same global optimization framework. The method is based on a binary Markov
  random field model which is defined on the product space of matches, and is shown
  to be equivalent to $0-1$ quadratic programming, and the MAXCUT graph problem. In
  general these problem are $N P$ complete. However our approach takes inspiration
  from the celebrated result of Goemans and Williamson (1995) that finds a polynomial
  time 0.879 approximation to several $N P$ complete, using semidefinite programming.
  The method is demonstrated for the problem of curve matching.
