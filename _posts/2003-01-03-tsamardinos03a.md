title: 'Towards Principled Feature Selection: Relevancy, Filters and Wrappers'
abstract: In an influential paper Kohavi and John [7] presented a number of disadvantages
  of the filter approach to the feature selection problem, steering research towards
  algorithms adopting the wrapper approach. We show here that neither approach is
  inherently better and that any practical feature selection algorithm needs to at
  least consider the learner used for classification and the metric used for evaluating
  the learner’s performance. In the process we formally define the feature selection
  problem, re-examine the relationship between relevancy and filter algorithms, and
  establish a connection between Kohavi and John’s definition of relevancy to the
  Markov Blanket of a target variable in a Bayesian Network faithful to some data
  distribution. The theoretical results lead to principled ways of designing optimal
  filter algorithms of which we present one example.
