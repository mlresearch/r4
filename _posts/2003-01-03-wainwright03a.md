title: Tree-reweighted Belief Propagation Algorithms and Approximate ML Estimation
  by Pseudo-Moment Matching
abstract: In previous work [10] we presented a class of upper bounds on the log partition
  function of an arbitrary undirected graphical model based on solving a convex variational
  problem. Here we develop a class of local message-passing algorithms, which we call
  tree-reweighted belief propagation, for efficiently computing the value of these
  upper bounds, as well as the associated pseudomarginals. We also consider the uses
  of our bounds for the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation. For
  a completely observed model, our analysis gives rise to a concave lower bound on
  the log likelihood of the data. Maximizing this lower bound yields an approximate
  ML estimate which, in analogy to the moment-matching of exact ML estimation, can
  be interpreted in terms of pseudo-moment-matching. We present preliminary results
  illustrating the behavior of this approximate ML estimator.
