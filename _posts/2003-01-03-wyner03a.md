title: On Boosting and the Exponential Loss
abstract: 'Boosting algorithms in general and AdaBoost in particular, initially baffled
  the statistical world by posing two questions: (1) Why is it that AdaBoost performs
  so well? and (2) What makes Boosting methods resistant to overfiting? In response
  to question (1) Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2000) take a statistical view of
  Boosting by recasting it as a stagewise approach to the minimization of an exponential
  loss function by means of an additive model in a process similar to additive logistic
  regression. This characterization has since been well integrated in the statistics
  and computer science communities as the best statistical answer to question (1).
  In this paper, we argue that this well assimilated view is questionable and that
  perhaps Boostingâ€™s success has nothing to do with the minimization of an exponential
  criterion or indeed any optimization at all. Our argument rests on a constructive
  theorem that states that for any sequence of classifiers there exists a linear combination
  for which the exponential criterion equals one. Furthermore, we present a Boosting
  algorithm which performs empirically like AdaBoost while stabilizing the exponential
  loss to a constant.'
