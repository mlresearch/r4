title: An Active Approach to Collaborative Filtering
abstract: 'Collaborative filtering allows the preferences of multiple users to be
  pooled in a principled way in order to make recommendations about products, services
  or information unseen by a specific user. We consider here the problem of online
  and interactive collaborative filtering: given the current ratings and recommendations
  associated with a user, what queries (new ratings) would most improve the quality
  of the recommendations made? This can be cast in a straightforward fashion in terms
  of expected value of information; but the online computational cost of computing
  optimal queries is prohibitive. We show how offline precomputation of bounds on
  value of information, and of prototypes in query space, can be used to dramatically
  reduce the required online computation. The framework we develop is quite general,
  but we derive detailed bounds for the multiplecause vector quantization model, and
  empirically demonstrate the value of our active approach using this model.'
