  title     = {A Bayesian Approach to Bergman's Minimal Model},
  pages     = {1-8},
  abstract  = {The classical minimal model of glucose disposal was proposed as a powerful modeling approach to estimating the insulin sensitivity and the glucose effectiveness, which are very useful in the study of diabetes. The minimal model is a highly ill-posed inverse problem and most often the reconstruction of the glucose kinetics has been done by deterministic iterative numerical algorithms. However, these algorithms do not consider the severe ill-posedness inherent in the minimal model and may only be efficient when a good initial estimate is provided. In this work we adopt graphical models as a powerful and flexible modeling framework for regularizing the problem and thereby allow for estimation of the insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness. We illustrate how the reconstruction algorithm may be efficiently implemented in a Bayesian approach where posterior sampling is made through the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We demonstrate the method on simulated data.}

  title     = {Planning by Probabilistic Inference},
  pages     = {9-16},
  abstract  = {This paper presents and demonstrates a new approach to the problem of planning under uncertainty. Actions are treated as hidden variables, with their own prior distributions, in a probabilistic generative model involving actions and states. Planning is done by computing the posterior distribution over actions, conditioned on reaching the goal state within a specified number of steps. Under the new formulation, the toolbox of inference techniques be brought to bear on the planning problem. This paper focuses on problems with discrete actions and states, and discusses some extensions.}
